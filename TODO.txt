TODO:
-Change ElemList to handle expressions in exponents
-simplify() method for Operator,Container
	-Container trig identities
-equals() method for Operators,Container,Constant,Variable
-derive() method for Operator,Container,Constant,Variable
-Add negative numbers
-Check evaluate() method for Operator,Container,Constant,Variable
-Add most possible containers (trig,log,abs,fact)
-Polynomial division, multiplication, factoring
-Constants (pi,e)
-composition
-Simplify exponents of 1,0
-Add undefined/indeterminate options
-Add logarithms of variable base
-Handle 1/0, 0/0
-Handle large numbers, scientific notation
-Create new data type for extra extra large numbers
-Change string before plugging into Expression?  ex. sec becomes 1/cos, log becomes 2 arg log function, ! becomes container, etc.
-log Operator
-Create exceptions for 1/0, 0/0, invalid containers, etc.

Simplify:
	-Simplify children
	-Get addends & factors of children
