Thoughts on using Enums in MathEngine:
-Turn Expression into interface, all subclasses are implementations
-Move static classes from Expression to separate utility class, or use default class
-Replace Operator class with Operator enum, with same methods and attributes as before (must check how implements keyword affects methods and attributes)
-???--*Alternative*: leave abstract class/extends structure, have operator enum that implements operator interface which extends Expression abstract class--???
-Repeat changes to Operator with Container class- use enums for trig/log functions
-Try to eliminate parent --> child typecasting
-Use either ordinal() or instance field to easily get precedance number for operators
